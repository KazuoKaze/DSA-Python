( This repo isn't completed yet, as I'm still learning and updating it regularly. Don't worry, though—I’m committed to finishing the entire DSA course. ) 

If you'd like to learn alongside me, here's how you can get started :

Download the Word Document: Access the repository and download the attached Word file.

Explore the Code Folder: Inside the repository, locate the code folder. Each file in this folder covers a specific DSA topic, with explanations, real-life use cases, and detailed code examples, including breakdowns to help you understand.

Study the Concepts: Carefully read through each topic, focusing on both the theoretical concepts and their practical applications.

Practice with LeetCode: Once you've grasped the concepts, apply your knowledge by solving problems on LeetCode. Regular practice will help you build logic and deepen your understanding of each topic.

By following these steps, you'll develop a strong foundation in DSA and enhance your problem-solving skills through consistent practice.
